# ‚öôÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏è Security Operations Automation - Architecture and Design
This project explains how to automate security operations and change management workflows by implementing security tools and intergrations via design and architectural principles.
### Why automate?
- By automating Tenable with Splunk and ServiceNow, you establish a seamless, end-to-end vulnerability management workflow. This integration allows Splunk to prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk, while ServiceNow automatically handles the remediation process by creating, assigning, and tracking tickets.
### What's the goal?
- The goal is to create an automated, closed-loop vulnerability management system that dramatically reduces the time it takes to identify, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities. This process streamlines the entire workflow, connecting vulnerability data to security analytics and the security operations team's workflow to ensure that critical issues are addressed quickly and efficiently.

## Objectives
1. üîé üéØ Discover, Inventory and scan assets for vulnerabilities using Tenable Vulnerabiliyt Management (Nessus)
2. üì• üìä Aggregate vulnerability and asset data using SPLUNK (SIEM) to manipulate, create report and generate trending dashboards
3. ‚öôÔ∏è üéüÔ∏è Automate ticket creation for critical vulnerabilities to streamline security operation tasks using ServiceNow (ITSM)
